The data set contains data obtained from an experiement involving 30 volunteers who worn smartwatch while perfomring one of six activities:
1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING

The data set summarises key sensor data by activity type and volunteer (subject).

Variables included are as follows:
Activity - identifies one of the six activities
Subjects - identifies the volunteer (from 1 to 30)

The rest of the variables are represent summarised data from the signal data obtain from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals Acc-XYZ and Gyro-XYZ (t in front of the name denotes time i.e. tAcc-XYZ, while f denotes frequency e.g. fAcc-XYZ).
From the signal variables mean and standard deviation per obsevation per subject were estimated.
The variables included in this data set then represent a summary of those means and standard deviations per subject and activity.
